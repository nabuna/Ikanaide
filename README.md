# Ikanaide
Ikanaide is a community-oriented website focused on the japanese culture that envolves anime, manga and related.

It's currently under development, on it's early stage. Only the frontend is being worked at the moment; as I am designing the website at the same time as I'm coding it, I don't want to add a backend I won't use in the end, so that's for the later.

# Current plans
Even though a great individual experience is guaranteed, the main idea for this website is to **really** focus on community aspects. 
I want it to be a place where people can have a good time and they can reflect their thoughts on the genre throught multiple tools that are meant to be implement in the future. 
The website will also be constantly open of ears to public criticism and proposals.

# Fundation
I really have no clue about this for now, since I never run a project like this, I don't really know the quantities of money needed, but the goal is for it to be run under donations.
I don't like ads and don't develop this for money at all.

# Expected release date
I'm quite ambitious on the quality of the project, so an exact date is hard to say, but I hope I can do it by the end of summer 2022.
